/* Primary TODO list:
 * - Place on top of collapsed sets (or not? ðŸ˜ˆ)
 * - Better source of randomness. Does Arduboy have analogue in we can sample
 *   noise from?
 * - A main menu and means to exit back to it
 * - Recognize when puzzle is complete.
 * >> Minimum viable game!
 * - Fixed set of puzzles? Or maybe just choose number of dice sets?
 * - There will be a bug if two collapsed sets end up in the same column
 *   (and aren't the same color themselves). Try to reproduce, then consider
 *   if it's worth fixing. Can probably simplify to only check for two; a third
 *   is VERY unlikely.
 *
 * Maybe list?
 * - Consider allowing placement on top of collapsed sets. It seems a
 *   good challenge without this, though.
